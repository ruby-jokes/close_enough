## SYNOPSIS

Sometimes when deadlines are tight, speed becomes more important than accuracy. How many times have we had to face failing tests because fo one little typo in a method signature?

Close Enough fixes this. By calculating the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between existing methods and what you actually typed, we infer the intended method from method calls with small typographical errors (an edit distance of < 3).

## USAGE

It's easy.

`gem install close_enough`

and

`require close_enough` in your project.

With bundler:

`gem 'close_enough', :require => 'close_enough'`

Then:

```ruby

o = Object.new
o.closs

=> Object

"foo".lentgh

=> 3

[1, 2, 3].redcue(:+)
=> 6
```

## CONTRIBUTING

Really? You have that much time on your hands? Awesome!

Two guidelines, though:

- Please include tests for all pull requests. Bonus points for feature branches!
- No monkey-patching `BasicObject` without grave justification. We're not that crazy.
